# Data Analyst Program

This repository is a collection of my project works for the "Data Analyst" nanodegree program by Udacity. The program prepares students for a career as a data analyst by helping them learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions and clearly communicate critical findings. The program consists of four main sections and each section comes with a project work at the end. 

These projects works are not only designed to enhance students' understanding of course material, but also provides a hand-on experience through which students would develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL.


## Section: Introduction to Data Analysis

Skills learned:
- Use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
- Use Jupyter Notebook to combine explanatory text, math equations, code and visualizations in one sharable document
- Steps in a typical data analysis process
- Wrangling the data into a desired format for analysis
- Investigating datasets with vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas
- Communicating the results of the analysis with plots in Matplotlib
