This is a final project for the "Data Visualization" section of "Data Analyst" Nanodegree course by Udacity. The project consists of two parts - exploratory data analysis and explanatory data analysis. In exploratory data analysis, Python data science and data visualization libraries are used to explore the dataset's variables and the data's structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. In explanatory data analysis, visualization plots are created to communicate the findings.

Skills learned from this project:

- Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data
- Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing one to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features
- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience

About the data

This project analyses the use of a bike sharing service in San Francisco - Bay area with the data directly retrieved from the website of the service. (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data). The dataset contains information about individual rides, including start and end station, duration, time, and user information. For the scope of the project, data about more than 2 million bike sharing rides from May 2018 to April 2019 are collected for analysis. New variables are created to look into how the service is used.
