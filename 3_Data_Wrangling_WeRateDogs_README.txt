This is a final project for the “Data Wrangling” section of “Data Analyst” Nanodegree course by Udacity. The subject of analysis for this project is WeRateDogs, a popular Twitter account that rates pet dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. Data on WeRateDogs are collected from different sources and then cleaned before a final analysis on its contents and features.

Completion of this project requires skills below:

- Gathering data from multiple sources, including programmatically downloading files and accessing data from APIs
- Importing data of various file formats
- Assessing data visually and programmatically
- Identifying data quality issues, such as validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity, and categorize them using metrics
- Cleaning data

About the Data

The data come from three sources:

- An archive dataset file of more than 5,000 tweets, which provides information on individual tweet id, text content of the tweet, reply status, re-tweet status, ratings, name and breed of the dog. The information of ratings, dog name and dog stage was extracted programmatically from the text content of the tweet and needs further cleaning
    
- Data on the breed of the dog in the tweet based on image prediction. The data is stored on Udacity’s server and needs to be downloaded programmatically

- Data via the Twitter API on tweet id, retweet count, and favorite count
