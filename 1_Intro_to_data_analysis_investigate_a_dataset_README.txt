This is a final project for the “Introduction to Data Analysis” section of “Data Analyst” Nanodegree course by Udacity. 

Knowledge and skills I learned from this project include:

- Steps in a typical data analysis process
- Wrangling the data into a desired format for analysis
- Investigating datasets with vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas
- Communicating the results of the analysis with plots in Matplotlib

About the Data

The dataset for analysis collects information from more than 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil. Each entry in the dataset is a medical appointment, which includes the date for which the appointment was scheduled, the actual appointment date, location of the hospital, information about the patient, such as his or her gender, age, health conditions, and social welfare status.

The goal of this project is to find potential trends among the patients who were absent from the appointment, and how they differed from the patients who showed up. Existing and created variables are evaluated and compared to provide statistical description of these two groups and to identify factors for further examination of statistically significant correlations.
