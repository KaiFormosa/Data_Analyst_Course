About the Data

This project analyzes an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce company. The company developed a new web page with the hope that it would increase the sales by the visitors of the page.

The goal of this project is to go through each analysis step and help the company decide if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment longer to make their decision.
